            <blockquote>
                <sup>1</sup> I was born in Metro Manila, Quezon City, at St. Luke’s Medical Center along E. Rodriguez. 
                <sup>2</sup> My family was strong, and we were happy during those times. 
                <sup>3</sup> I still remember those moments fondly. 
                <sup>4</sup> We lived with my father’s side of the family, sharing a house with my grandparents in Cubao. 
                <sup>5</sup> However, as time passed, my parents decided to live separately from my grandparents, so we moved to
                a new home near Marikina City.
                <sup>6</sup> That was where I completed my preschool education. 
                <sup>7</sup> As the months went by, my parents started having frequent misunderstandings and arguments. 
                <sup>8</sup> Their fights became more intense, and the tension in our home grew. 
                <sup>9</sup> I have a younger sister, and even though we were still young, we could feel the weight of their problems.
                <sup>10</sup> My mother, unable to handle the emotional pain, decided to leave.
                <sup>11</sup> She took my sister and me with her, and we moved in with her sister in Tandang Sora. 
                <sup>12</sup> We lived there for about three months, hoping for a fresh start. 
                <sup>13</sup> However, my mother realized that staying in Manila was not the best option for us.
                <sup>14</sup> She decided to return to her hometown in Cotabato, where her family lived. 
                <sup>15</sup> That marked another big change in my life as I continued my studies there. 
                <sup>16</sup> I lived in Cotabato for two years, occasionally visiting my father in Manila. 
                <sup>17</sup> Eventually, my mother asked me where I wanted to continue my studies.
                <sup>18</sup> After thinking about it, I chose to move back to Manila and stay with my father. 
                <sup>19</sup> My sister remained in the province to continue her education. 
                <sup>20</sup> Returning to Manila, I resumed my schooling and graduated from grade school.

            <blockquote>
                <sup>1</sup> Now that I had graduated from grade school, I was about to face a new challenge. 
                <sup>2</sup> It was an unfamiliar environment, and I wasn’t sure if my friends from grade school would enroll in the same high school. 
                <sup>3</sup> On top of that, the education system had changed, and high school now included Senior High School. 
                <sup>4</sup> During my teenage years, I realized a lot of things I hadn't before. 
                <sup>5</sup> One of the biggest things was feeling that something was missing in my life. 
                <sup>6</sup> Coming from a broken family, I often felt envious of my friends who had both parents around. 
                <sup>7</sup> Holidays were particularly hard because I had to split time between my mom and dad. 
                <sup>8</sup> Even though this arrangement seemed fair, I couldn't shake the sadness. 
                <sup>9</sup> I started to feel resentment towards my mom for not reaching out more. 
                <sup>10</sup> Technology was advanced, but she barely called or messaged. 
                <sup>11</sup> That feeling of emotional distance affected me deeply. 
                <sup>12</sup> Over time, though, I found solace in my high school friends. 
                <sup>13</sup> They became my second family, and my high school years turned out to be amazing. 
                <sup>14</sup> Basketball also played a huge role in my life, helping me build confidence. 
                <sup>15</sup> Through sports, I met new people and formed strong friendships. 
                <sup>16</sup> I also experienced my first love, which was exciting and new. 
                <sup>17</sup> Being surrounded by friends made me appreciate life more. 
                <sup>18</sup> Even though I carried emotional baggage, my teenage years were filled with unforgettable moments. 
                <sup>19</sup> I slowly let go of my resentment and focused on the good. 
                <sup>20</sup> I learned that despite hardships, there are always reasons to be grateful.

            <blockquote>
                <sup>1</sup> Now, I am facing another challenge—college. 
                <sup>2</sup> Once again, I feel nervous and uncertain. 
                <sup>3</sup> Unlike before, my dad told me to handle everything by myself. 
                <sup>4</sup> I had to enroll, manage my schedule, and prepare for this new chapter alone. 
                <sup>5</sup> There were no tutors this time; I had to rely on my own learning. 
                <sup>6</sup> My dad's only condition was: no failing grades. 
                <sup>7</sup> He didn’t pressure me to get high honors, just to pass all subjects. 
                <sup>8</sup> I am currently a second-year IT student. 
                <sup>9</sup> At first, IT wasn’t my dream course, but I learned to appreciate it. 
                <sup>10</sup> Technology is an in-demand field, offering many career opportunities. 
                <sup>11</sup> Though I'm not yet skilled in coding, I try my best to improve. 
                <sup>12</sup> College is challenging not just academically but also mentally. 
                <sup>13</sup> The reality of adulthood is slowly sinking in. 
                <sup>14</sup> I now understand that I must take things seriously. 
                <sup>15</sup> I need to become independent and responsible. 
                <sup>16</sup> My dad’s lessons in life are starting to make sense. 
                <sup>17</sup> He prepared me for the real world in his own way. 
                <sup>18</sup> Looking back, my first year was more relaxed, but now, the pressure is intense. 
                <sup>19</sup> College has taught me valuable life lessons beyond academics. 
                <sup>20</sup> I am determined to finish strong and build a good future.
